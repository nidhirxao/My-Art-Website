MY ART WEBSITE

What is it?
 
This project was made for the purpose of my Web and DB class but I will be using it as my official art website. It has been heavily inspired by one of my favorite artists- Pypah Santos’s website. 

In order to buy my artwork, the user will have to log in with their credentials. 

If they do not already have an account, they will have to register by mentioning their name, email and password. Once registered, the user will be prompted to login into their account. 

Once logged in :

The user’s name, a cart and a logout option will be displayed on the top right corner of the page . 

The user can now scroll through the page to have a look at my illustrations, the name of the illustrations and their respective prices. 

Cart :

If they wish to purchase any of my art prints, they can add it to the cart after which the number of products they add to the cart will be displayed on the cart symbol. 

Once the user clicks on the cart, they will be directed to the checkout page. 

Check out page :

Here, there is an option to increase the quantity of each artwork. 

The total price of the user’s purchase along with any discounts will be displayed on the right side of the page. 

Below, the total price is where the user can make their purchase after which a “purchase successful” page will be displayed. If the user wishes to continue shopping, they can choose that button which will take them back to the products page.

Log out :

If the user wishes to log out at any time, they can click on the logout icon which will log them out of their account.
