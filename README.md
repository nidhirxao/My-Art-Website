# MY ART WEBSITE

## What is it?
 
This project was made for the purpose of my Web and DB class but I will be using it as my official art website. It has been heavily inspired by one of my favorite artists- Pypah Santos’s website.

In order to buy my artwork, the user will have to log in with their credentials.

If they do not already have an account, they will have to register by mentioning their name, email and password.

Once registered, the user will be redirected to the login website. This will take a few seconds.

* Once logged in :

On the top, there is a navbar that consists of the About and FAQ page which users can go through to get to know about me and my website.

The user can now scroll through the page to have a look at my illustrations, the name of the illustrations and their respective prices. 

* Cart :

If they wish to purchase any of my art prints, they can add it to the cart after which the number of products they add to the cart will be displayed on the cart symbol.

Once the user clicks on the cart, they will be directed to the checkout page. 

* Check out page :

Here, there is an option to increase the quantity of each artwork.

The total price of the user’s purchase along with any discounts will be displayed on the right side of the page.

Below the total price is where the user can make their purchase after which a “purchase successful” page will be displayed. If the user wishes to continue shopping, they can choose that button which will take them back to the products page.

The "continue shopping" button will take the user back to the shopping page where they can purchase more art prints if they'd like.

I wish to add more entities in the future. 

## Bugs/Issues I am willing to fix in the future :

* Reduce the time it takes to redirect the user from the registration page to the login page. 
* Adding an option for users to logout from their account.
* The Shop button on the top most Navbar is not linked to anything currently. 
* Improved CSS throughout the website. 
* Adding an option for users to add their bank account details.
