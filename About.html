    <h1> - About the artist - </h1>
   <h3> Hello friends! My name is Nidhi and I am a character/sketch illustration artist. I work with a variety of mediums including watercolours, gouache, markers, coloured pencil and more to create very colourful and vibrant illustrations.
    Most of my works are often focused on strong yet feminine portraits and figures, drawing inspiration from pop culture, disney movies and fashion. 
    I enjoy sharing my artwork through my social media platforms as well as providing insight to my art process.</h3>
